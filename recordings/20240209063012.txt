Danielle: Gregory, I've run into another problem. My audio isn't working during video conferences. I can see everyone, and they can see me, but I can't hear anyone, and they can't hear me.

Gregory: That's quite problematic, especially with the importance of video conferencing today. Let's start by checking your audio settings in the video conferencing app. Can you ensure the correct microphone and speakers are selected?

Danielle: Let me check... Yes, they're correctly selected. I even tried switching them just in case, but no luck.

Gregory: Interesting. Let's do a quick test of your microphone and speakers outside of the conferencing app. Can you play a video or a song to see if your speakers work?

Danielle: Sure, one second... Okay, I can hear the video just fine.

Gregory: Good, that means your speakers are working. Now, let's test your microphone. Can you record a quick voice memo or use the sound recorder?

Danielle: Done. And... I can hear my recording. So, both the microphone and speakers seem fine.

Gregory: That's good news. It narrows down the issue to the conferencing app or its settings. Let's uninstall the app, restart your computer, and then reinstall the app. It's a bit of a brute force approach, but it often resolves these quirky issues.

Danielle: Okay, all set. Should I try joining a test call?

Gregory: Yes, please do. Let's see if this has fixed the issue.

Danielle: Gregory, it worked! I can hear and be heard on the call now. Thank you!

Gregory: Fantastic! I'm glad that resolved it. Sometimes a fresh install is all it takes. Is there anything else troubling you today?

Danielle: No, that was the last of it. I really appreciate your help, Gregory.

Gregory: It's my pleasure, Danielle. If anything else comes up, don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day!
